Project: Do homework, try to implement z_i^(t+1) using Metropolis-Hastings instead of sampling from TruncNorm directly

Sample z_i^(t+1) from TN(x_i^T beta^t, 1; (-infty, 0])
- Propose zi* from N(zi(t), vi^2)
- Eval log(alpha) = log(pi(zi*)) - log(pi(zi^t))
- Accept if log(U) < log(alpha)
- return zi* or zi^t
